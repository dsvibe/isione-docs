# Style Guide

Design decisions that apply across all IsiOne components (web, Android, iOS, hardware).

## Task Identity

These elements identify tasks to users and must be consistent across all platforms.

### Icons

All task icons use [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/), an open-source icon library.

### Task Label Font

The font used for task names/headings across all platforms.

**[Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito)** - A sans-serif with rounded terminals, friendly and legible at small sizes.

- Use **Medium (500)** or **Semi-Bold (600)** weight
- Semi-Bold recommended for 3D printed hardware labels

## Platform-Specific Styles

Fonts for body text, UI elements, and other non-task content are defined per-platform in their respective documentation.
