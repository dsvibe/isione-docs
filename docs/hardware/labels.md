# Labels

IsiOne uses two types of printed labels to identify tasks in physical spaces.

## NFC Tag Labels

Square labels containing only an icon. The NFC tag is inserted within the label, which is then placed at the task location (e.g., on an appliance, near a chore area).

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Shape | Square |
| Content | Icon only (no text) |
| Purpose | Identifies the task location for NFC scanning |

## Enclosure Slot Labels

Labels with both text and an icon that slide into a slot on the 3D printed enclosure. This design allows tasks to be reassigned over time without reprinting the enclosure.

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Shape | Rectangular (sized for enclosure slot) |
| Content | Icon + text |
| Purpose | Identifies which task each status LED represents |

## Style

Icons and task label font are defined in the project-wide [Style Guide](../style-guide.md) to ensure consistency across web, mobile, and hardware.
